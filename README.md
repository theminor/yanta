Yet Another Note Taking App (yanta) is a simple note-taking and task management app.

**Status:** *Still very much a work in process. Only basic functionality is implemented as of yet!*

Why another to-do/note app? None of them do what I want. Here are the features I hope to add at some point:

- [ ] Use git to track note changes
- [ ] encryption - end-to-end (nothing stored on server that isn't encrypted) - with the ability to turn this on or off
- [x] self-hosted or not hosted at all (completely in-browser)
- [x] Markdown-based notes and to-do lists
- [ ] Api or api-like ability to create, modify, and delete notes from other sources
- [x] Progressive Web App
- [ ] Possible integration with github for sync/storage? Other sync solutions?

Apps like Laverna and Turtl do a lot of these things but not all.
