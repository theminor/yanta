Yet Another Note Taking App (yanta) is a simple, git powered, encrypted, note-taking and task management app.

*Currently designing - I haven't started it yet.*

Why another to-do/note app? None of them do what I want. Here are the features we are looking for:

- Uses git to track note changes
- encrypted end-to-end (nothing stored on server that isn't encrypted)
- can be self-hosted
- Markdown Note styling
- Api or api-like ability to create, modify, and delete notes from other sources
- Progressive Web App - all runs server-side, written in javascript, node for back-end
- Possible integration with github (store data in a github repo?)/ability to sync/backup to cloud storage

Apps like Laverna and Turtl do a lot of these things but not all.
